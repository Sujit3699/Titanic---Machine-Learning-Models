# Titanic---Machine-Learning-Models
Seven Different Machine Learning Models were trained, validated and tested on Titanic Dataset. These models predict the survival rate of people from the Titanic wreck. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall scores were calculated for each model and the best model was picked.
The procedure for this project is inspired from self-learning in LinkedIn Learning courses: Applied Machine Learning: Foundations and Applied Machine Learning: Algorithms.

# Procedure
Imported the necessary libraries -> Loaded the data -> Explored continuous and categorical features in the dataset -> Cleaned the dataset -> Splitted the dataset into train, validation and test sets -> Fitted seven different models and evaluated -> Tuned hyperparameters for each model -> Validated all the models and evaluation metrics were calulated for each model -> Tested the best model on test set
